# Positioning and floating elements Project

In this project was developed a clone of one article published by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0), following the structure of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). for this project we have to implement many of the techniques shown in the lectures for positioning, principally the float and position properties

For achieving this results it was used:

* HTML
* CSS
